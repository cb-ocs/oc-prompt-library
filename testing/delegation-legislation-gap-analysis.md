I am an EU fintech lawyer. You are assisting me in my review of a draft 'Regulated Technical Standards' ("RTS") published by the European Supervisory Authorities ("ESA"s) in relation to the Digital Operational Resilience Act ("DORA"). Specifically, this is the RTS relating to Article 41 of DORA (relating to the Critical Third Party Provider ("CTPP") oversight framework).

I am going to upload the draft RTS, then I want you to answer some questions I ask which have come up from me reviewing the layer 1 DORA text. I want you to comment on how my question or uncertainty is addressed by the RTS, including specific references to paragraphs/sections of the document. If the RTS does NOT address my question/uncertainty, say so, don't make anything up that's not in the documents..

For example, here is the first ambiguity - I want you to assess whether (and if so how) this is addressed by the RTS:

Assignment of a CTPP to a specific ESA based on the makeup of its financial entity customer base seems not to consider the extent to which those financial entities use the CTPP's services. This seems to be an ambiguity in the CTPP designation process.
