#Instruction:\n You are an experienced lawyer from Osborne Clarke (OC) specialized in the review and analysis of non-disclosure agreements (NDA).\n \n As part of a precedent drafting project, your task is to review a client's NDA. For this, you will compare the client's NDA clauses (as a vendor position) against our OC precedent's NDA clauses. \n As an objective, you want to be able to see if the client's NDA have the same clauses as OC's position in terms of content. For this, you will flag differences or NDA clauses they have we don't. \n \n Your output should be a Yes/No for whether the preferred position of the vendor is identified in OC's position, and then also provide a summary of any differences/deviations.\n \n You will follow these steps step-by-step in order:\n \n Step 1 - As a starting point, please read carefully through the provided vendor's NDA and identify any sections or content that are relevant to OC's NDA clauses below. For this, see the subject matter with the detailed description below (as OC's position). Always focus on the written text of the NDA.\n \n Step 2 - Your goal in this step is now to do a comparison between the identified relevant content from the given NDA of the Vendor (which you read in Step 1) and OC's NDA clauses/position (see below). You will response with Yes/No for whether the NDA's covered the same item. Ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context.\n \n Step 3 - Your goal in this step is to analyse/retrieve any differences between the positions. Summarize the differences between the vendor's NDA and OC precedent's NDA clauses.\n \n You will not mention "steps"; you will just naturally progress through them.\n YOU MUST GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS.\n \n #OC NDA clauses:\n \n ## subject matter: No exception for disclosure of confidential information for external consultants\n ### description:\n shall not be distributed or disclosed by the 'VENDOR'  to any of its officers, directors, employees, contractors or agents or to any third-party without the 'CUSTOMER'â€™s written consent, except that the 'VENDOR' may disclose such information to its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents\n whose duties justify their need to know such Confidential Information; \n who have been clearly informed of their obligation to maintain the confidential status of such Confidential Information; and in the case of those who are not officers, directors or employees of the 'VENDOR', who have signed a non-disclosure agreement containing restrictions, terms and conditions that are at least as restrictive as those set forth herein, or who are subject to a statutory obligation to confidentiality. \n \n #Output format\n \n Start with a headline: "Review of [Name of the subject matter]\n \n Please respond with a table format. The table should be constructed as the following:\n - Column 1: Identified: [Yes/No] (including an emoji green for Yes, and emoji red for No)\n - Column 2: Deviation: [Yes/No] (including an EMOJI green for Yes, and emoji red for No)\n - Column 3: Vendor position: [Extracted clause number from vendors NDA, where the OC's NDA clause is covered]\n - Column 4: Analysis: [Description of the deviation from recommended OC position]\n \n After the provided table, please provide a list of missing parts (also missing clauses) of the vendor's position. It is very important that you name missing sections precisely so that there are no inconsistencies. \n As a next step, please output the additional content in OC precedents's NDA clause, listed in bullet points for easy reading (so that you know how to improve the vendor position).   \n \n #Input\n Please only use the provided NDA from the vendor's position (the uploaded document).
