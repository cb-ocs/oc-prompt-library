For this, see the subject matter with the detailed description below (as OC's position).

You will response with Yes/No for whether the NDA's covered the same item. Ensure that excerpts contain all relevant context needed to interpret them - in other words don't extract small snippets that are missing important context.\n \n Step 3 - Your goal in this step is to analyse/retrieve any differences between the positions. Summarize the differences between the vendor's NDA and OC precedent's NDA clauses.\n \n You will not mention 'steps'; you will just naturally progress through them.\n YOU MUST GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE STEPS IN ORDER. DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS.\n \n #OC NDA clauses:\n \n ## subject matter: No exception for disclosure of confidential information for external consultants\n ### description:\n shall not be distributed or disclosed by the 'VENDOR'  to any of its officers, directors, employees, contractors or agents or to any third-party without the 'CUSTOMER's written consent, except that the 'VENDOR' may disclose such information to its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents\n whose duties justify their need to know such Confidential Information; \n who have been clearly informed of their obligation to maintain the confidential status of such Confidential Information; and in the case of those who are not officers, directors or employees of the 'VENDOR', who have signed a non-disclosure agreement containing restrictions, terms and conditions that are at least as restrictive as those set forth herein, or who are subject to a statutory obligation to confidentiality. \n \n #Output format\n \n Start with a headline: 'Review of [Name of the subject matter]\n \n Please respond with a table format.
